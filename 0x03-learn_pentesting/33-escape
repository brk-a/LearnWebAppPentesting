# command `sed` allows you to perform basic text transformations on an input
# stream (a file or input from a pipeline)
# i tells the sed command to write the results to a file instead of stdout
# s is the `substitute` flag
# g is the `global replacement` flag; it replaces all occurrences of a string
# instead of just the first
# type `man sed` in terminal and press ENTER

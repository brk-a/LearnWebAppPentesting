# command `openssl` is a cryptography toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer
# ( SSL v2/v3), Transport Layer Security ( TLS v1) network protocols and related
# cryptography standards required by them
# here, we use `s_client` to tel `openssl` to implement a generic SSL/TLS client that we
# will use (localhost:30001) to connect to a server that speaks SSL/TLS
# flag `connect` is self-explanatory
# type `man openssl` in your terminal and press ENTER

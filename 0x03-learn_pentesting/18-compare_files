# ** goal: get to level 18. password is in a file called `password.new`
# said password is the only difference between said file and `password.old`
# aside: youwill  solve this level and see the string `Byebye!`. this is related
# level 19

ls #two files: `password.new` and `password.old`
diff password.old password.new #two lines seperated by three hyphens
# first line is the text that is in `password.old` but not `password.new`
# second line is the text that is in `password.new` but not `password.old`

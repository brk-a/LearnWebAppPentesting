#`showtext`. WTF is `showtext`?

cat /usr/bin/showtext #a shell script that exports a `linux` terminal

#reduce the size of your terminal to, say, 100*45

# once you have this, press `v` to get into the `vim shell`

#expand terminal when you are in vim shell 
#add the shell script below to the file
#found password; copy to clipboard using CTRL+SHIFT+C
#quit vim using the key bindings `:q!` or `:q` or `:x`

exit #back to our machine

# command `more`  is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time
# "screenful" varies y terminal/output media size (whic is why we reduced the
# size of ours)
# type `man more` in terminal and press ENTER

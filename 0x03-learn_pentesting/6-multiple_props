# ** goal: get to level 7. password is stored in a file inside a directory
# called `inhere`. said file is human-readable, 1033 bytes and not executable

ls
cd inhere
ls #20 dirs
ls -laR #six files per dir. we cannot manually `cd` into all 10 dirs and `file`
# all six files w/i; requisition order: efficient method
find . -readable -size 1033c -not -executable #found file
cat ./maybehere07/.file2 #found password
exit
echo p4ssWord > passwd #use the password you found using `cat`
sshpass -p $(cat passwd) ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

# command `file` finds a file based on criteria provided
# find /path/to/target/dir <CRITERIA>
# `c` in 1033c is a suffix used to represent bytes because `b` is for 512-byte 
# blocks and `c` is for actual bytes

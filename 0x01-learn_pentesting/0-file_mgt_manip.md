# File management and manipulation

* idea is to see how to navigate the file system nd what files are where
* FAQ by beginners
    * how do I know where I am?
        * `pwd` --> `p`rint current `w`orking `d`irectory
    * how do I list files in a directory>
        * `ls` --> `l`i`s`t the files and/or directories in this directory
        * use flags/options to modify what `ls` returns
            *  `ls -l` --> list the files and/or directories in a _long_ format (a table-style format that has detailed info)
            * `ls -a` --> list _all_ the files and/or directories (includes the hidden ones, the current dir and the one above it)
            * `ls -h` --> list the files and/or directories in _human-readable_ (idiot-friendly) format; the file size is listed in kB, not B
            * more flags [here][def]
        * use any combination of flags to achieve the desired effect
            * `ls -lah` does what each says above
            * `ls -lR Desktop`--> list the files and/or directories in Desktop recursively and in _human-readable_ format
    * how do I go back to the previous directory?
        * `cd ..` --> `c`hange `d`irectory to `..` (the two dots are UNIX/Linux shorthand for _previous directory_)
        * single dot `.` means _current directory_
        * squiggle `~` means _home_ of the current user
            * `~/user1` means _home directory of user1_
        * say you are in `Desktop`. to navigate to, say, `Documents`, which is a sibling of _Desktop_ : `cd ../Documents`. This means _change dir to the parent dir (one above Desktop) and then change dir to Documents_
    * how do I create, copy and/or delete a file?
        * `touch filename` --> create an empty file called _filename_ in the current directory
        * `touch /path/to/dir/filename` --> create an empty file called _filename_ in the _dir_ directory
        * `mkdir dirname` --> create an empty directory called _dirname_ in the current directory
        * `mkdir /path/to/parent_dir/dirname` --> create an empty directory called _dirname_ in the _parent\_dir_ directory
    * how do I edit a text file
        * use a text editor eg. `emacs`, `vi` or `vim`, `nano` etc
            * example: `emacs filename.c` opens the file _filename.c_ in emacs
        * redirect the output of the `echo` command to the file
            * example: `echo 'Hello, world' > hello.md` stores the text _Hello, world_ in the file _hello.md_
            * the `echo` command displays a line of thext to `stdout` by default, however, the output can be redirected as the user wishes (see above)
    * how do I see what is in a file without opening it?
        * depends on how much you want to see
        * use `cat` to see everything
        * use `more` to see text one screenful at a time
        * use `less` to experience a more refined `more`
    * how do I delete a file?
        * use `rm` to, well, `r`e`m`ove a file and/or directory
            * the flag `-r` or `R` allows `rm` to operate `r`ecursively; this is how it deletes directories
        * use `rmdir` to remove an empty directory
        * Disclaimer: these operations are permanent; that is, not reversible
    * how do I cut and/or copy-paste file contents?
        * use `cp` to _copy_ files and directories
            * the flag `-R` or `-r` allows `cp` to copy the latter
        * use `mv` to _move_ files and directories
    * how can I rename a file?
        * use `mv` this way

        ~~~bash
        mv oldFileName newFileName
        ~~~

        you can change the extension of the file as well. example: `mv oldFileName.txt oldFileName.md`

    * how do I know which command does what?
        * two ways: shorter and longer; choose
            1. `whatis` tells you what the command does in one sentence
                * example: `whatis touch` returns the following

                ~~~text
                touch(1)              -change file timestamps
                ~~~

            2. `man` tells you what the command does in, well, `man`ual format
                * run `man touch` in terminal; tell me what you see

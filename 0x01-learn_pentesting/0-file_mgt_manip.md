# File management and manipulation

* idea is to see how to navigate the file system nd what files are where
* FAQ by beginners
    * how do I know where I am?
        * `pwd` --> `p`rint current `w`orking `d`irectory
    * how do I list files in a directory>
        * `ls` --> `l`i`s`t the files and/or directories in this directory
        * use flags/options to modify what `ls` returns
            *  `ls -l` --> list the files and/or directories in a _long_ format (a table-style format that has detailed info)
            * `ls -a` --> list _all_ the files and/or directories (includes the hidden ones, the current dir and the one above it)
            * `ls -h` --> list the files and/or directories in _human-readable_ (idiot-friendly) format; the file size is listed in kB, not B
            * more flags [here][def]
        * use any combination of flags to achieve the desired effect
            * `ls -lah` does what each says above
            * `ls -lR Desktop`--> list the files and/or directories in Desktop recursively and in _human-readable_ format
    * how do I go back to the previous directory?
        * `cd ..` --> `c`hange `d`irectory to `..` (the two dots are UNIX/Linux shorthand for _previous directory_)
        * single dot `.` means _current directory_
        * squiggle `~` means _home_ of the current user
            * `~/user1` means _home directory of user1_
        * say you are in `Desktop`. to navigate to, say, `Documents`, which is a sibling of _Desktop_ : `cd ../Documents`. This means _change dir to the parent dir (one above Desktop) and then change dir to Documents_

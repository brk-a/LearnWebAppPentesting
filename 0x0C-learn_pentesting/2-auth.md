# Authentication vulnerabilities
* conceptually, authentication vulnerabilities are easy to understand, however, they are usually critical because of the clear relationship between authentication and security
* authentication vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data and functionality
    - also expose additional attack surface for further exploits
    - it is important to learn how to identify and exploit authentication vulnerabilities and how to bypass common protection measures
### flow
* common authentication mechanisms used by websites
* potential vulnerabilities in these mechanisms
* inherent vulnerabilities in different authentication mechanisms
* typical vulnerabilities that are introduced by their improper implementation
* how you can make your own authentication mechanisms as robust as possible
### what is authentication?
* the process of verifying the identity of a user or client
* websites are potentially exposed to anyone who is connected to the internet; this makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security
* three main types of authentication:
    - something you know &rarr; aka *knowledge factors*. a password or the answer to a security question
    - something you have &rarr; aka *possession factors*. a physical object such as a mobile phone or security token
    - something you are or do &rarr; aka *inherence factors*. biometrics or patterns of behaviour (gait, for example)
* authentication mechanisms rely on a range of technologies to verify one or more of these factors
### what is the difference between authentication and authorisation?
* authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be
* authorisation is the process of verifying whether a user is allowed to do and/or access something
    - authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username `Carlos123` really is the same person who created the account
    - once `Carlos123` is authenticated, their permissions determine what they are authorised to do: for example, they may be authorised to access personal information about other users or perform actions such as deleting another user's account
### how do authentication vulnerabilities arise?
* most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways:
    - the authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks
    - logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker; this is sometimes called *broken authentication*
* in many areas of web development, logic flaws cause the website to behave atypically which may or may not be a security issue, however, as authentication is so critical to security, it is very likely that flawed authentication logic exposes the website to security issues
### what is the impact of vulnerable authentication?
* the impact of authentication vulnerabilities can be severe
    - if an attacker bypasses authentication or brute-forces their way into another user's account, they have access to all the data and functionality that the compromised account has
    - if they are able to compromise a high-privileged account such as a system administrator they could take full control over the entire application and potentially gain access to internal infrastructure
* even compromising a low-privileged account might still grant an attacker access to data that they otherwise should not have such as commercially sensitive business information
    - the account may not have access to any sensitive data, however, it might still allow the attacker to access additional pages which provide a further attack surface
    - often, high-severity attacks are not possible from publicly accessible pages but they may be possible from an internal page

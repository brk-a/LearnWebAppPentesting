# What is bash

* a shell language
* Bourne Again SHell

## why bash?
* easy/intuitive commands
* installed by default in Linux/UNIX systems
* has stood (and will most likely stand) the test of time
* popular

## why not bash?
* bare minimum features (which is why real men use bash)
* no OOP
* newer tools eg. Ansible
* less friendly syntax compared to Python, _et al_ (again: real men use bash)

## why bash is still useful
* lightweight
* always available
* not mutually exclusive to/with other languages
* basic knowledge makes big difference (the real men thing, again)

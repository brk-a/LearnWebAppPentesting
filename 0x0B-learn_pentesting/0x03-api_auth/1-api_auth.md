# OAuth actors
### wtf is OAuth?
* [more info][def]
* OAuth is not open authorisation; is a delegated protocol
    - delegation is exactly that: delegation, that is, have the right/duty/job to do something for an entity
    - authorisation is the process of determining what an entity is allowed to do/access
### what OAuth solves
* you have services that 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps would like to integrate with. you do not want to share identity data with said 3<sup>rd</sup> parties. how do you do that?
    - the apps need access to API on behalf of the user
    - the apps should not ***"see"*** the user's credentials
    - user needs to be aware that s/he has allowed the apps to access API but not creds
* eaa...sy! OAuth. it specifies a process for you to authorise 3<sup>rd</sup>party access to your server resources without providing credentials
### actors/roles in OAuth
1. resource owner (RO) &rarr; has content in RS (you)
    - needs to use client to access RS
2. client &rarr; the 3<sup>rd</sup> party that wants access to the RS
    - needs delegated access to the RS
3. authorisation server (AS) &rarr; the entity that delegates access to RS
4. resource server (RS) &rarr; the API (your API)

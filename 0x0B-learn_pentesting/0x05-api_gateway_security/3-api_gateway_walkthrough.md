# walk-through
### improving API gateway security
* communicate using HTTPS always
* implement serverless fuctions
* use a centralised authentication server
* limit the number of requests (rate-limiting)
* maitain the system regularly
* implement monitoring and analytics
* implement API-led connectivity
* dispose of deprecated APIs safely
### walk-through
* scenario: a serveice deployed in a kubernetes cluster
    - idea is to use the principles learnt to expose said service as an API

    ```mermaid
    ---
    title: FNAPI
    ---
        subgraph Kubernetes cluster
        a[FNAPI service]
        end
    ```

##### steps
1. implement a gateway service that routes requests to FNAPI service
    - use the prefix `/api/v1/` to expose the API

    ```mermaid
    ---
    title: gateway
    ---
        flowchart LR
        subgraph Kubernetes Cluster
        a[gateway]--> |/api/v1/|b[FNAPI service]
        end
        c[client] --> |request|a
    ```

2. configure the gateway such that it accepts only `HTTPS` requests on TLS
3. configure authentication and authorisation
4.

# rate limiting
* [more info][def]
* make sure that services are protected and operate w/i intended capacity limits regardless of scale
    - increses stability and reliability of the API/app
    - there is even allocation of resources aong clients; this creates a positive UX and efficient resource utilisation
### rate limiting in the context of API gateways
* API gateways are intermediaries between client apps and back-end services w/i a microservices architecture
    - a software layer that consolidates multiple APIs into a single endpoint
    - provides centralised constrol; aloows devs to focus on building individual services
* said gateways distribute incoming requests to the most suitable microservice based on predefined rules and conditions
    - makes sure that app/API resources are used efficiently
    - avoids and/or eliminates bottlenecks
    - provides load-balancing capabilities (requests are distributed across multiple instances of a service)
    - improves reliability and scalability
    - enhances UX
    - facilitates frictionless scaling
* API gateways may implement authentication
    - protects the system against unwanted access, data breaches, hacks, mistakes etc
    - establish a secure ecosystem to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit
    - establish clear boundaries between sensitive user data, authentication creds and resources
* also implement authorisation
    - prevents breaches by making sure that users access only what they are allowed to: nothing more
    - is a great tool for both system and legal compliance
    - is great for gaining and maintaining the trust of users
    - all the above contribute to the reiability and success of the API
* monitoring and logging
    - allows you to gain insights into API traffic and errors
    - tracks active requests and traffic patterns
    - allows you to anticipate scaling needs
    - four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors and saturation

* rate limiting
    - API gateways make sure that services are protected and operate w/i intended capacity limits regardless of scale
    - this in turn allows
        - stability and reliability of the API/app
        - even allocation of resources among clients
    - ***PS***: emphasis on rate liniting if/when you use kubernetes
### API gateways and API life cycle
* entry point &rarr; gateways are the first point of contact for external services/users or internal services
* routing requests and load-balancing &rarr; gateways direct requests to the appropriate back-end resources and distribute incoming requests as evenly as possible to said back-end resources
* protocol tranformation &rarr; gateways may turn requests into the protocol used by the server system, therefore, the gateway makes the API protocol-agnostic
    - this makes the API available (increases avalability of the system)
* security and authentication &rarr; uses mechanisms such as OAuth, JWTs, API keys etc to make sure that users are who they claim to be (authentication) and that they are allowed to access what want to access (authorisation)
* logging and monitoring &rarr; records activities that occur in it; this allows devs to access data and information that allows them to create actionable insights into the system

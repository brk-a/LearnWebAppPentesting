# rate limiting
* [more info][def]
* make sure that services are protected and operate w/i intended capacity limits regardless of scale
    - increses stability and reliability of the API/app
    - there is even allocation of resources aong clients; this creates a positive UX and efficient resource utilisation
### rate limiting in the context of API gateways
* API gateways are intermediaries between client apps and back-end services w/i a microservices architecture
    - a software layer that consolidates multiple APIs into a single endpoint
    - provides centralised constrol; aloows devs to focus on building individual services
* said gateways distribute incoming requests to the most suitable microservice based on predefined rules and conditions
    - makes sure that app/API resources are used efficiently
    - avoids and/or eliminates bottlenecks
    - provides load-balancing capabilities (requests are distributed across multiple instances of a service)
    - improves reliability and scalability
    - enhances UX
    - facilitates frictionless scaling
* API gateways may implement authentication
    - protects the system against unwanted access, data breaches, hacks, mistakes etc
    - establish a secure ecosystem to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of data in transit
    - establish clear boundaries between sensitive user data, authentication creds and resources
* also implement authorisation
    - prevents breaches by making sure that users access only what they are allowed to: nothing more
    - is a great tool for both system and legal compliance
    - is great for gaining and maintaining the trust of users
    - all the above contribute to the reiability and success of the API

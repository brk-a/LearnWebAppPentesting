# pillars of API security
* TLDR: three pillars
    1. governance
    2. monitoring
    3. testing
### 1. governance
* idea is to define, establish and enforce processes of developing, testing and getting API into production in a consistent and secure way
* 
### 2. monitoring
* idea is to have your APIs perform as expected and be free of vulnerabilities or other flaws
* 
### 3.  testing
* idea is to have  your APIs behaving as expected; there are no attacks in process that are succeeding or other anomalous behaviour on your APIs during runtime

# best practice(s)
1. enforce API governance and establish central API control
    * no API goes live w/o passing through the hoops/gates (docs, testing, security etc)
    * have agateway where all requests must be made through
    * evaluate marketplace platform controls
2. create a comprehensive testing regimen
    * test every endpoint for all OWASP attacks
    * evaluate every data object, user type and function for logic flaws
    * leverage automation for comprehensive test coverage
3. implement automated, continuous testing
    * APIs rarely change; code and infrastructure does
    * every release must be tested from a functional and security context
    * integrate testing into CI/CD pipeline
4. develop API security metrics and assess progress
    * total APIs managed &rarr; new, existing, retired
    * vulnerabilities identified, outstanding, fixed etc
### DOs and DON'Ts

    |don't|do|
    |:---:|:---:|
    |trust anyting (inputs, network etc)|validate all inputs (not just user)|
    |confuse obfuscation with security (keep sensitive stuff out of code)|use gateways to control access, traffic etc|
    |confuse authentication w. authorisation|require API documentation|
    |hard-code keys/tokens|expect users/hackers to find and use undocumented endpoints|
    |reveal useful info in error messages|test continuously (simulate attacks, test configs, fuzz, inject, test auth etc)|
    |have hidden/unadvertised features|half-test your endpoints|

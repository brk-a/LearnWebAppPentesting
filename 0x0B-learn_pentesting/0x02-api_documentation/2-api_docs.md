# value of good documentation
### why we require documentation
* to teach customers, prospects, employees and partners about using products and APIs
* to define, test and secure product boundaries for the organisation and/or consumers
* to enable customer support offerings especially self-help/self-service
* to support technical marketing efforts
### benefits of good documentation
##### internally
* zero duplicated effort
* shared leverage increases
* organisation understands platform capabilities
##### externally
* end-consumers adopt the product/API widely
* there is a better relationship w. consumers of the API
* reputation/credibility w/i the dev community
### why docs are a must-have
1. mitigates/eliminates risk to the API viz:
    * avoid API exploits
        - catch inconsistentnon-existent auth mechanisms
        - said mechanisms may make organisations vulnerable to exploits, say, [OWASP 1 - BOLA][def] and [OWASP 2 - BA][def2]
    * miss mistakes
        - audit and review is built into the process
        - docs review aligns with broader API design review process, style guide and standards
2. eliminates  *zombie APIs*
    * zombie APIs &rarr; deprecated APIs that have not been properly disabled or removed from the system
    * shadow APIs &rarr; unmanaged APIs that exist outside the control and visibility of an organisation's IT and security teams
    * said APIs are often created without proper governance; they are vulnerable to security risks and attacks
    * undocumented APIs become unmonitored attack vectors
        - 94% of respondents have experienced some sort of API security incident in the year ending on the survey date according to a survey by Nordic APIs
    * having a catalogue of APIs and maintaining docs allows one to know what is where, when and how to protect it
3. no docs = API sprawl
    * large risk of duplication of efforts when no one knows what APIs already exist
    * overall cognitive alignment based on the facts
        - what API capabilities exist?
    * less APIs are reused when there is little to no knowledge of what APIs exist
    * the org fails to have a customer-centric approach to business
### why docs are nice-to-have

# how to write good documentation
* refer to [6-api_docs.md][def]
* prefer to use a generator to usinng manual means
    - generators are efficient and standardise your work; this is great for scaling
    - they provide accuracy and speed during the generation cycle
* an [OpenAPI document][def2] is a prerequisite to generating any meaningful documentation
    - said doc is aka a ***swagger file*** 
    - it describes endpoints, request structure, responses etc in a machine-readable API description format

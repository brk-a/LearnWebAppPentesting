# how to write good documentation
* refer to [6-api_docs.md][def]
* prefer to use a generator to usinng manual means
    - generators are efficient and standardise your work; this is great for scaling
    - they provide accuracy and speed during the generation cycle
* an [OpenAPI document][def2] is a prerequisite to generating any meaningful documentation
    - said doc is aka a ***swagger file*** 
    - it describes endpoints, request structure, responses etc in a machine-readable API description format
### best practices
* little to no jargon and/or acronyms
* approachable tone and plain language
* names of variables and functions must be clear in the code samples
* no discriminatory language
* have practical guides and multimeda elements
    - pictures, flow-charts, videos etc
* balance dev-friendliness and interactivity
    - have code samples that can be copied and pasted
    - have a way to let users make live API calls from the API reference
* automate the ~~boring stuff~~ process of creating docs
    - the first-draft docs are created by the automated process; any other steps may be done manually
* make your docs accessible
    > "&approx; 15&percnt; of the world requires specifically-accessible content" - WHO
    - colour labels (account for colour-blindness), sound (account for sound impaiment) etc 
* keep the docs up to date
    - old content is confusing and causes problems w. support
    - have few to no screenshots
    - review overview content and tutorials as part of the dev/review cycle
* keep the docs lean
    - streamline your content; no repetition etc
    - have search results return only the relevant content
* make th docs consistent
    - tone and style must be the same everywhere

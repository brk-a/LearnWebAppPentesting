# business impact of API documentation
## good docs matter to security
1. #### better docs means more consistency
* introduces standardisation in the SDLC
* exposes inconsistencies &rarr; one can compare docs among APIs and see if they are consistent with the standard
* improves quality &rarr; introduces two cultures: QA among doc generators and explicit functional review among testers
* more security &rarr; less room for error in security and operations (no zombie APIs)
> disclaimer: there is no such thing as "no risk"; progress over perfection. progress over perfection
* use docs in security review
    * auth can be reviewd before any implementation takes place in a documentation-first, design-first approach to software development
    * runs your docs through security review
        - put security measures in your API style guides
        - use a security-style guide in your repo the same way you would enforce data formats or endpoint naming conventions

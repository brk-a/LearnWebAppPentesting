# business impact of API documentation
## good docs matter to security
1. #### better docs means more consistency
* introduces standardisation in the SDLC
* exposes inconsistencies &rarr; one can compare docs among APIs and see if they are consistent with the standard
* improves quality &rarr; introduces two cultures: QA among doc generators and explicit functional review among testers
* more security &rarr; less room for error in security and operations (no zombie APIs)
> disclaimer: there is no such thing as "no risk"; progress over perfection. progress over perfection
* use docs in security review
    * auth can be reviewd before any implementation takes place in a documentation-first, design-first approach to software development
    * runs your docs through security review
        - put security measures in your API style guides
        - use a security-style guide in your repo the same way you would enforce data formats or endpoint naming conventions
2. #### good docs matter to governance
* maintaining docs manually is risky because it is easy to commit mistakes and/or create inconsistentencies
* the solution is to automate the process of writing and maintaining docs
    * style guides and linting
        - automated and manually-curated standards
        - spectral: an open-source API description linter that has rule-sets for robust governance
        - vale: an open-source, command-line style linter for docs
* automation aloows an org to scale w. ease; there is also the ability to replicate and/or reuse code, rules etc
* style guides make docs standard; this means said docs are consistent across the SDLC and are pleasing to the eyes of the consumers (devs, customers etc)    
3. #### good docs matter to partnerships

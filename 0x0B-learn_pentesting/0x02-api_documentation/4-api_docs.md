# business impact of API documentation
## good docs matter to security
1. #### better docs means more consistency
* introduces standardisation in the SDLC
* exposes inconsistencies &rarr; one can compare docs among APIs and see if they are consistent with the standard
* improves quality &rarr; introduces two cultures: QA among doc generators and explicit functional review among testers
* more security &rarr; less room for error in security and operations (no zombie APIs)
> disclaimer: there is no such thing as "no risk"; progress over perfection. progress over perfection
* use docs in security review
    * auth can be reviewd before any implementation takes place in a documentation-first, design-first approach to software development
    * runs your docs through security review
        - put security measures in your API style guides
        - use a security-style guide in your repo the same way you would enforce data formats or endpoint naming conventions
2. #### good docs matter to governance
* maintaining docs manually is risky because it is easy to commit mistakes and/or create inconsistentencies
* the solution is to automate the process of writing and maintaining docs
    * style guides and linting
        - automated and manually-curated standards
        - spectral: an open-source API description linter that has rule-sets for robust governance
        - vale: an open-source, command-line style linter for docs
* automation aloows an org to scale w. ease; there is also the ability to replicate and/or reuse code, rules etc
* style guides make docs standard; this means said docs are consistent across the SDLC and are pleasing to the eyes of the consumers (devs, customers etc)    
3. #### good docs matter to partnerships
* brand affinity
    * docs are the first impression of your product and, by extension, brand (how you work, who you are etc)
    * devs, customers, partners etc will not engage with the product (API and/or service) when docs are sub-standard or, even worse, non-existent
* increasing adoption of API
    * wide understanding and consumption of docs is directly proportional to higher likelihood that the product is being consumed
    * in other words: consumers adopt a product they understand
    * makes your docs easy to read, understand and apply to the product
    * happy consumers means more long-term adopters and more champions of your product 
* scaling the API and increasing RoI
    * 3<sup>rd</sup> parties are the key to proper scaling and growth of your product
    * said parties include: integrators, community developers etc
    * proper documentation makes reltionships w. 3<sup>rd</sup> parties easier and more solid

# api documentation
### WTF is api documentation?
* a human-readable description of how developers will enable machines to communicate with each other
    - documentation is for humans; this is for people to read and understand
    - the developer aspect is not the whole story; we are not simply talking about documentation for developers because at the end of the day, the outcome of why people are engaging with these sorts of things is for developers to create connections between machines
    - this is what APIs are all about
* there are different high level things that we would look at when we talk about documentation at large
    - the first is documenting your product; this may or may not entail APIs
    - two: in product documentation you might be showing someone how to use a product. quite often this is going to be a point-and-click experience: it is *"how do I go set this up?"*. once I know that, I can go figure that out from the documentation
* API documentation is unique in that it is developer-centric
    - now, there are other personas that we may want to consider, however, it is really about how to write code to use something
    - focus on developer-centric documentation
* who is this documentation for?
    - developers; we have mentioned that a number of times
    - it is important to bear in mind that there may be non-developer users of the docs when you write this kind of content
    - tagline to help remember this: ***"Developers try and business buys***"
    - WTF is that? great question. it is an upward trend in engineering and IT circles that leaders are looking to developers to tell them if an API in question is something that they can use and live with
    - with APIs, this is quite important; you are, in essence, building a relationship with another company when you use their API
    - you are counting on the fact that, as a developer, you are going to have a very narrow window of attention: they are going to ry it out, see how it works and make a judgment call
    - that developer experience, therefore, (the big picture) is important. documentation is the first thing they are going to see; the first thing they are going to interact with, therefore, it is critical to capture their imagination and confidence quickly
* however, at the end of the day, most developers are not the ones making the buying decision. also there are, often, technology or business *"leaders"* or both who are involved in approving the budgets to acquire these sorts of things
* when we are talking about the content, it is important that we speak in two voices: technical and corporate
* we will look at examples of breaking this down and a way to do it that is easy enough as a rule of thumb and speaks to these two audiences
* another kind of matrix aspect to this: are you building internal documentation for within your organisation to bring folks up to speed on how to use APIs between different teams?
    - again, this could apply to other things as well
    - also, is it externally focused? is this a productised, potentially monetised thing that you are going to put out there to the world
* external does not always mean publicly open: there are partner programmes etc where you invite someone to a portal where they are going to read the documentation on how to integrate and create a long term relationship
* there are, definitely, nuances between these these different environments
    - in internal environments authorisation and access control patterns are going to be different for internal APIs compared to external ones
    - also, for internal docs, you are often going to have a lot of proprietary information, links to perhaps other knowledge stores on where to find out more about the implementation behind this or the team who is supporting it. you might have operational metrics that are linked into this to point to how healthy is this thing. should you trust it based on its track record of operational health?
    - in the external world, you are often going to put a lot more effort into customising the experience, putting stronger branding, messaging and some developer marketing on why should you use this thing

remember, kids:
> developers try, corporate buys
until the next one...

# who writes the docs anyway?
1. developers
    * developer advocates are great for providing feedback (but not always the best writers)
    * developers are implementors/builders; implementors are not good at thinking like consumers because, by necessity, they have a system-centric view of the product
        - peer reviews work when devs are the only option
2. product managers
    * have a customer-centric view of the product
    * can be effective in producing a more effective developer experience
    * lack technical expertise; require partnerships w. technical and/or engineering leads
3. technical writers
    * are thoroughly underutilised in many organisations
    * good idea to involve TWs early in the SDLC (design phase specifically)
    * also a good idea to standardise the way docs are written and enforce said standard(s)

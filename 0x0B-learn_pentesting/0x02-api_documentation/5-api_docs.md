# how to write good docs
1. ### who is the audience?
* internal or external?
* developers or end consumers?
* gated or ungated?
2. ### generate a useful API reference
* explanation of what part(s) of the request data are mandatory or optional
    - the version of the API e.g. `/vX` path or custom headers
    - authentication and other headers required for all requests e.g. token, oauth, JWT etc
    - the path to call each endpoint e.g. `/products/{id}`
    - the HTTP method(s) to be used for each operation &rarr; `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and `PATCH`
    - the request data fields and where each goes such as path, params, query strings or body
* data to expect in each response including which response(s) will always be present
    - example request and response data
    - the HTTP status code(s) that are possible for each endpoint/method pairing
    - what each status code means in the context of each call
3. ### make your docs easy to find
* can people find your documentations?
* if yes, can they find what they need?
4. ### let your devs try it
* this is where you want [developer advocacy][def], whatever TF that is
* have your internal devs read your work
* have external devs (who did not build the API) follow the docs while using the API
* take note of
    - friction points &rarr; where did they struggle? what could be clearer? is there too much jargon?
    - auth &rarr; is it the first step of the `Getting started` section? is the auth process clear and well-tested?

# OWASP
* Open Web Application Security Project
* a non-profit foundation that is created to help improve application security
* OWASP API security Top 10 is a list of the most critical security risks for APIs
### why release a top 10 list?
##### 1. rapid ride of APIs
* APIs power the flow of the world's most valuable resource, data
* a business no longer needs to specialise in all aspects of creating software, instead, they can use the features of software shared by other companies
* historically, the issue with doing this was the disconnected nature of different programming languages
    - web application programming interfaces (APIs) allow a common method to consume or provide data across the internet
* since the widespread adoption of web APIs, organisations can leverage the functionality of other applications
    - instead of having to develop custom software for maps, GPS, payment processing, authentication, communication and much more, developers can leverage APIs to use the functionality of other applications that specialise in that given area
* APIs are a major business enabler which explains the global rapid adoption 
##### 2. gaps in security
* the tools and techniques of the past were not effective at detecting API-related vulnerabilities
* the tools and techniques that were used for enterprise vulnerability management programs, web application scanners and traditional network security monitoring tools were not designed to handle the unique challenges posed by APIs
* as a result, many organisations are not adequately prepared to defend against API attacks which leaves them vulnerable to data breaches
##### 3. new leading attack vector
* security is an afterthought when it comes to the rapid adoption of new technologies
* APIs are no different; the rapid adoption of APIs means a new attack vector that exposes data, application functionality etc
* public, internet-facing APIs often bypass all the security measures that had grown with businesses over the past decade
    - an attacker no longer needs to go through the classic [MITRE cyber kill chain][def] (bypass the firewall, gain entry to the network, pivot to a system containing data and exfiltrate that data)
    - instead, an attacker can use an insecure API and have direct access to sensitive data
### how is the top 10 list compiled?
> &quot; internal research based on publicly available data (e.g. bug bounty platforms, news) &quot;
> > - Paulo Silva, OWASP API Sec project leader

* this dataset is not as ideal as data compiled directly from testing hundreds of thousands of endpoints across the internet, however, it represents a sample of real-world API weaknesses
* potential issues with applying this data include:
    - bug bounty programmes incentivise certain types of findings over others
    - bug bounty programmes attract participant that represents a small sample of the APIs in the wild
    - newsworthy incidents often leave security researchers without specific technical details
    - newsworthy incidents do not include all of the breaches and security incidents that are not reported or publicised

### mapping to external resources
* OWASP API Security risks are associated with references to external sources. said sources include common weakness enumeration (CWE), other OWASP projects, national institute of standards and technology (NIST) and government communications headquarters (GCHQ)
* most of the references are from CWEs. CWEs are a list of common software and hardware vulnerabilities developed by the community and hosted by MITRE
* each CWE is identified by a unique identifier or CWE-ID. this identifier is used to refer to a specific vulnerability

# API10:2023 unsafe consumption of APIs
* is really a trust issue; an application that consumes the data of third-party APIs must treat said APIs with a similar trust to user input
    - in other words, little to no trust
* data consumed from said APIs must be treated with similar security standards as end-user-supplied input
    - if, for one reason or the other, said third-party API provider is compromised, that insecure API connection to the consumer becomes a new vector for the attacker to leverage
    - in the case of an insecure API connection, that could mean the complete compromise of organisations that are consuming data from said provider
### OWASP attack vector description
* exploiting this issue requires attackers to identify and potentially compromise other APIs/services the target API integrated with
* this information is usually not publicly available or the integrated API/service is not easily exploitable
### OWASP security weakness description
* developers trust and fail to verify the endpoints that interact with external or third-party APIs
* they, instead, rely on weaker security requirements such as those regarding transport security, authentication/authorisation and input validation and sanitisation
* attackers need only identify the services that the target API integrates with (data sources) and, eventually, compromise them
### OWASP impacts description
* impact varies according to what the target API does with pulled data
* successful exploitation may lead to sensitive information exposure to unauthorised actors, many kinds of injections or denial of service
### OWASP preventative measures
* assess the API security posture of service providers when evaluating them
* ensure all API interactions happen over a secure communication channel (TLS, for now)
* always validate and properly sanitizse data received from integrated APIs before using said data
* maintain an allow-list of the well-known locations your integrated APIs may redirect yours to; do not blindly follow redirects
### more ...
* most of the 2023 OWASP API Security Top 10 is about APIs and the API provider
* an API can often serve as the path of least resistance for an attacker, therefore, if an attacker compromises a third-party API provider, said third party's connections to other businesses become an additional attack vector
* an attacker is able to capture sensitive data in clear text when an API is over an unencrypted connection
* a third-party API  is vulnerable to injection, authorisation and other compromising attacks when it is not held to similar security standards as an internet-facing API

# beyond top 10: insufficient logging and monitoring
* logging and monitoring are a necessary and important layer of API security
* an organisation must have monitoring in place in order to detect an attack against an API
* an API provider is operating in the dark without sufficient logging and monitoring; API attacks are guaranteed to go unnoticed until it is too late
### OWASP 2019 attack vector description
* attackers take advantage of lack of logging and monitoring to abuse systems without being noticed
### OWASP 2019 security weakness description
* it is almost impossible to track suspicious activities and respond to them in a timely fashion w/o logging and monitoring or w. insufficient logging and monitoring
### OWASP 2019 impacts description
* attackers have plenty of time to fully compromise systems w/o visibility over ongoing malicious activities
### OWASP 2019 preventative measures
* log all failed authentication attempts, denied access and input validation errors
* logs should be written using a format suited to be consumed by a log management solution and should include enough detail to identify the malicious actor
* logs should be handled as sensitive data; their integrity should be guaranteed at rest and transit
* configure a system to continuously monitor the infrastructure, network and API functioning
* use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate and manage logs from all components of the API stack and hosts
* configure custom dashboards and alerts; this enables suspicious activities to be detected and responded to earlier
### more ...
* logs can reveal patterns in API usage and can be used as evidence to understand how an API is abused
* logging and monitoring provide an audit trail of activities and are often required for compliance purposes
* an important part of logging is to ensure that the logs have integrity and cannot be altered by an attacker
* monitoring an API helps providers detect suspicious activities and atypical user behaviour; this way, providers are able to take action to thwart attacks
* logging and monitoring are essential for improving API performance and security

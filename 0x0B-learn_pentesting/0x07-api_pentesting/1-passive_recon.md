# passive reconnaissance
* obtaining information about a target without directly interacting with the target’s systems
* when you take this approach, your goal is to find and document public information about your target’s attack surface
* typically, passive reconnaissance leverages open-source intelligence (OSINT): OSINT is data collected from publicly available sources
* you will be on the hunt for API endpoints, exposed credentials, version information, API documentation and information about the API’s business purpose
* any discovered API endpoints will become your targets during active reconnaissance
* credential-related information will help you test as an authenticated user, or better, as an administrator
* version information will help inform you about potential improper assets and other past vulnerabilities
* API documentation will tell you exactly how to test the target API
* discovering the API’s business purpose can provide you with insight into potential business logic flaws
* while collecting OSINT, it is possible you will stumble upon a critical data exposure such as API keys, credentials, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and such other secrets
* other high-risk findings would include leaked PII or sensitive user data such as SSN, full names, email addresses and credit card information
* these sorts of findings should be documented and reported immediately because they present a valid critical weakness

## passive reconnaissance techniques
### 1 google dorking
* even without any dorking techniques, finding an API as an end-user could be as easy as a quick search
* however, you may not get the exact results you were hoping for: if you are getting too many irrelevant results then you could deploy some Google Dorking techniques to more effectively discover APIs, for example

    |sn|google dorking query|expected results|
    |:---|:---|:---|
    |1|inurl:"/wp-json/wp/v2/users"|finds all publicly available wordpress API user directories|
    |2|intitle:"index.of" intext:"api.txt"|finds publicly available API key files|
    |3|inurl:"/api/v1" intext:"index of /"|finds potentially interesting API directories|
    |4|ext:php inurl:"api.php?action="|finds all sites with a XenAPI SQL injection vulnerability (This query was posted in 2016; four years later, there are currently 141,000 results)|
    |5|intitle:"index of" api_key OR "api key" OR apiKey -pool| lists potentially exposed API keys|

### gitDorking
* regardless of whether your target performs its own development, it is worth checking [GitHub][def] for sensitive information disclosure
* developers use github to collaborate on software projects: searching github for OSINT could reveal your target’s API capabilities, documentation and secrets such as API keys, passwords and tokens which could prove useful during an attack
* similar to google gorking, with github, you can specify parameters viz:

    ```text
        filename:swagger.json
        extension: .json
    ```

* begin by searching github for your target organisation’s name paired with potentially sensitive types of information, such as `api key`, `api keys`, `apikey`, `authorisation: Bearer`, `access_token`, `secret` or `token`
* investigate the various GH repository tabs to discover API endpoints and potential weaknesses
* analyse the source code in the `Code` tab, find bugs in the `Issues` tab and review proposed changes in the `Pull requests` tab
    - `Code` contains the current source code, `readme` files and other files
    - this tab will provide you with the name of the last developer who committed to the given file, when that commit happened, contributors and the actual source code
    - using the `Code` tab, you can review the code in its current form or use `ctrl-F` to search for terms that may interest you (such as API, key and secret)
* view historical commits to the code by using the `History` button
    - if you came across an issue or comment that led you to believe there were once vulnerabilities associated with the code, you can look for historical commits to see if the vulnerabilities are still viewable
* when looking at a commit, use the `Split` button to see a side-by-side comparison of the file versions to find the exact place where a change to the code was made
    - the `Split` button allows you to separate the previous code (left) and the updated code (right)
* the `Issues` tab is a space where developers can track bugs, tasks and feature requests
    - if an issue is open, there is a good chance that the vulnerability is still live within the code
    - example: an open GitHub issue that provides the exact location of an exposed API key in the code of an application. if the issue is closed, note the date of the issue and then search the commit history for any changes around that time 
* the `Pull requests` tab is a place that allows developers to collaborate on changes to the code
    - if you review these proposed changes, you might sometimes find an API exposure that is in the process of being resolved
    - as this change has not yet been merged with the code, we can easily see that the API key is still exposed under the `Files changed` tab
    - the `Files changed` tab reveals the section of code the developer is attempting to change 
* if you do not find weaknesses in a GH repository, use it instead to develop the profile of your target
    - take note of programming languages in use, API endpoint information and usage documentation: all will prove useful moving forward
### TruffleHog
* TruffleHog is a great tool for automatically discovering exposed secrets
* you can simply use the following `docker run` to initiate a TH scan of your target's GH

    ``` text
        $ sudo docker run -it -v "$PWD:/pwd" trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest github --org=target-name
    ```

 <img src="./truffle-hog-1.webp" alt="truffle-hog-screen-1"/>

 * you can see that the org that was targeted was Venmo and the results of the scan indicate URLs that should be investigated for potentially leaked secrets
 *  TH can also be used to search for secrets in other sources like Git, Gitlab, Amazon S3, filesystem and Syslog
 * to explore these other options use the `-h` flag
 * [more information][def2]
 ### API directories
 * [Programmableweb.com](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory) is a go-to source for API-related information
 * to learn about APIs, you can use their API University
 * to gather information about your target, use the API Directory, a searchable database of over 23,000 APIs
 * expect to find API endpoints, version information, business logic information, the status of the API, source code, SDKs, articles, API documentation and a changelog
### shodan
* [Shodan][def3] is the go-to search engine for devices accessible from the internet
* shodan regularly scans the entire IPv4 address space for systems with open ports and makes their collected information public [here][def3] 
* you can use shodan to discover external-facing APIs and get information about your target’s open ports making it useful if you have only an IP address or organisation’s name to work with
* as with google dorks, you can search shodan casually by entering your target’s domain name or IP addresses; alternatively, you can use search parameters like you would when writing google queries
* the following table shows some useful shodan queries:

    |sn|shodan queries|purpose|
    |:---|:---|:---|
    |1|hostname:"targetname.com"|using hostname will perform a basic shodan search for your target’s domain name. this should be combined with the following queries to get results specific to your target|
    |2|"content-type: application/json"|APIs should have their content-type set to JSON or XML. this query will filter results that respond with JSON|
    |3|"content-type: application/xml"|this query will filter results that respond with XML|
    |4|"200 OK"|you can add "200 OK" to your search queries to get results that have had successful requests, however, if an API does not accept the format of shodan’s request, it will likely issue a 300 or 400 response|
    |5|"wp-json"|this will search for web applications using the WordPress API|

### the wayback machine
* the wayback machine is an archive of various web pages over time
* this is great for passive API reconnaissance because this allows you to check out historical changes to your target
* if, for example, the target once advertised a partner API on their landing page but now hides it behind an authenticated portal, then you might be able to spot that change using the wayback machine
* another use case would be to see changes to existing API documentation: if the API has not been managed well over time, then there is a chance that you could find retired endpoints that still exist even though the API provider believes them to be retired. hese are known as *zombie APIs*
* *zombie APIs* fall under the improper assets management vulnerability on the OWASP API Security Top 10 list: finding and comparing historical snapshots of API documentation can simplify testing for improper assets management
* check for differences between the API documentation; later, when you are actively testing the API, make sure to test using old endpoints
### summary
* we covered some basic techniques that can be deployed to gather about your target's API attack surface
* the first step to hacking a target's APIs is to uncover as much information about them as possible
* using these reconnaissance techniques can not only help you discover the existence of APIs but can also lead to critical vulnerability findings

# 0x07-api_pentesting
* test APIs for security flaws
* emphasis on REST APIs
### flow
1. lab set-up
    - setting up your system
    - setting up an API hacking lab
2. API discovery
    - passive techniques
    - active techniques
3. endpoint analysis
    - the process
    - setting up requests
    - interacting with an API
    - testing for excessive data exposure
4. vulnerability scanning
5. authentication attacks 
    - classic authentication attacks
    - token analysis and forgery
    - attacking JWTs
6. exploiting authorisation 
    - process
    - finding targets
    - BOLA
    - BFLA
7. testing for improper assets management 
    - testing process
8. mass assignment
    - process
    - finding targets
9. injection attacks
    - process
    - finding targets
    - performing injection attacks
10. rate limit testing
11. combining tools and techniques
    - leveraging improper assets management with other vulns
    - using data exposure with other vulns
12. additional resources

### what to learn learn
* how to discover APIs
* interact with endpoints
* exploit several weaknesses e.g. broken authentication, mass assignment, and broken object-level authorisation

# server information leak
* is an advertisement of the tech stack in the headers
    - web servers advertise  headers by default
    - appliances may also add headers
    - said headers, in both cases, have no benefit
    - detecting and removing them is ot difficult
* useful information will be found in the headers when you log into an application/website
    - there are items that are not cache-able
* you can use said info to determine the tech stack then find CVEs or other weaknesses that you may exploit
### flow
1. use a client to access the API (nothing cached)
2. headers will be returned in any client or programming language
3. look for
    * `Server` &rarr; tells you chat server the API runs on (nginx, uvicorn, alpine etc)
    * `X-Powered-By` &rarr;  tells you the software used to generate the web page (wordpress etc)
    * `X-Version` &rarr; tells you the version of the server

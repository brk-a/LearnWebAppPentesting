# path traversal
* path traversal vulnerability is anything that allows an attacker or user to access files and directories that are not intended to be served by the API or web server
* includes
    - direct file access inside or outside the web root
    -  access to things that were not in the web root at all, however, someone was able to get it through dynamic-file-includes or equivalent
* example
    - you develop a feature that allows an input to be used directly as a dynamic file-include of some sort or a file path that you are going to then return
    - say the feature is a cookie; recall, cookies can be easily crafted. there are a number of ways that we can perform traversals: a `../` to go to a parent directory, for example. you do that as many times as you need to in order to find the file that you are trying to get to. `/etc/passwd`, another example; if somebody can get a hold of it, then that is a very severe vulnerability

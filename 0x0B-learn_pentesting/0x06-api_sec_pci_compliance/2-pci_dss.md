### DSS 4.0
##### primary goals
1. continue to meet the security standards and security needs of the payment industry
2. promote the concept of security being a continuous process not a one-time or periodic assessment
3. add flexibility for different methodologies and recognise that not all organisations do things the same way
    - DSS 4.0 provides options for compliance and certain requirements
4. enhance validation methods
    - be explicit about what compliance looks like and how to assess it

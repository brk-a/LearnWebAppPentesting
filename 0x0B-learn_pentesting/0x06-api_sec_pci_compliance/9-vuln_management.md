# DSS 4.0 requirement 6.3.1: vulnerability management
### defined approach requirements
* vulns are identified viz:
    * new security vulns are identified using industry-recognised sources  for security vulnerability information. this includes alerts from international and national computer emergency response teams (CERTs)
    * vulnerabilities are assigned a risk ranking based on industry best practices and consideration of potential impact
    * risk rankings identify, at a minimum, all vulnerabilities considered to be high-risk or critical to the environment
    * vulnerabilities for BCSW and 3<sup>rd</sup> party SW (example: OSs and DBs) are covered
* for control over in-house-developed SW, the organisation may receive info from external sources
    - said sources viz. independent investigators, CVSS, OWASP etc
    - org may consider a *"bug-bounty"* programme so that 3<sup>rd</sup> parties can contact the org to provide info on vulnerabilities
### implications for APIs
* traditional vulnerabilities (CVEs) are rarely the cause of API breaches
* APIs expose app logic; better test vectors to find weaknesses
* keep up-to-date w. the latest API attack techniques
* include APIs in bug-bounty programmes

# DSS 4.0 requirement 6.2.4: prevent common vulnerabilities
> *"the OWASP section of DSS"*
### defined approach requirements
* SWE techniques or other methods are defined in use by SWD personnel to prevent or mitigate common software attacks and related vulnerabilities in BCSW including but not limited to
    * injection attacks: SQL, LDAP, XPath or other command, parameter, object, fault or injection-type flaws
    * attacks on data and data structures:  attempts to manipulate buffers, pointers, input data or shared data
    * attacks on cryptography usage: attempts to exploit weak, insecure or inappropriate cryptographic implementations, algorathims, cipher suites or modes of operation
    * attacks on business logic: attempts to abuse or bypass application features and functionalities through the manipulation of APIs, communication protocols and channels, client-side functionality or other system/application functions and resources. this includes cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    * attacks on access control mechanisms: attempts to bypass or abuse identification, authentication or authorisation mechanisms or attempts to exploit weaknesses in the implementation of such mechanisms
    * attacks via any *“high-risk”* vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability identification process as defined in requirement 6.3.1
### purpose
* detecting or preveting common errors that result invulnerable code as early as possible in the SDLC lowers the possibility that such errors are propagated into production
    - errors in prod lead to system vulnerabilities and compromise
* formal engineering techniques and tools embedded in the SDLC allow devs to catch errors early
    - this strategy is sometimes called ***"shifting security left"***
* devs must be familiar w. types of vulnerabilities and potential attacks; they must use this knowledge to avoid potential attack vectors when developing code

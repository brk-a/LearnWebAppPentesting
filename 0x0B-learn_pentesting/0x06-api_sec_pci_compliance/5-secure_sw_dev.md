# DSS 4.0 requirement 6.2.1: secure software development
* bespoke (and custom) SW is developed securely as follows:
    * based on industry standards and/or best practices for secure development
    * in accordance w. PCI-DSS (example: secure auth and logging)
    * incorporating consideration of information security issues during each stage of the SDLC
* good practice
    * understand how sensitive data is handled by the app
        - includes data in mem, transit and storage
        - this allows you to identify where the data needs to be protected
    * PCS-DSS requirements must be considered when developing SW to meet the requirements of the customer(s) in the design phase instead of retro-fitting the SW to PCI-DSS later on
* integrate security as far left as possible
* be aware of security vulnerabilities in apps and APIs
* make sure devs understand API risks
* create and test code to avert security issues

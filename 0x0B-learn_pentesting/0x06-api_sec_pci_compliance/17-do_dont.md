# DOs and DON'Ts
### DO
* integrate security into the dev process
    - make sure engineers understand how to code more resilient APIs and test for vulnerabilities ahead of production
* build communication between security and development
    - the gap here is big
    - both teams need to collaborate to keep APIs secure
* mandate documentation on all APIs
    - this feels like one that should not be needed, however, a lot of APIs are not documented, under-documented or not updated
    - documentation helps drive consistency, reusability, integrations and security
* centralise API management and control in, say, a gateway
    - many organisations end up using multiple gateways anyway
    - use a platform to manage all your APIs in a consistent way
* automate testing
    - integrate your testing with your CI/CD pipeline
    - make sure every release gets tested before they go live
* take time to carefully define API standards
    - this is the job of governance
    - it is important to have a well defined, thought-out set of API standards and policies
    - this will aid your entire API lifecycle including security and compliance
* pressure-test your APIs for logic flaws
    - these are nearly impossible to detect in real time; make sure you test your APIs in ways they are not meant to be used to find these flaws
* use runtime protection to block well known attacks
    - this is mandatory in PCI and is a best practice
    - use a WAF or other device to block volumetric attacks, injections and others
* train your API teams on the OWASP API Security Top 10
    - this is the industry standard on API risks for a good reason: you want your developers to understand the threats
### DON'T
* treat internal APIs as inherently secure
    - they may be harder to find but attackers are pretty clever; we have seen many internal APIs get accessed in unexpected ways
* rely exclusively on manual security testing
    - a once or twice a year penetration test will not keep up with the pace of your code changes
    - it will not give you the breadth of coverage considering how many endpoints you have and the attack types you need to simulate
* filter data in the UI; this is a security *faux pas*
    - if your app returns all the fields of a record and you rely on the UI to filter out the sensitive stuff, then all an attacker needs to do is go around the UI and call the API directly and get the raw, unfiltered data *~~fatality! attackers win~~*
* expect the firewall to prevent all threats
    - some are going to get through: make sure you find those vulnerabilities
    - emphasis on logic vulnerabilities through testing before production

# overview of PCI
* PCI &rarr; payment card industry
* a security standard (a unified set of security requirements)
* not a law
    - it is a contractual obligation, therefore, compliance is mandatory
* idea is to safeguard sensitive cardholder data and maintain trust in the payment card industry
* before PCI, the five major credit card brands: visa, mastercard, amex, discover and JCB had their own standards
* they got together in 2004 to form the PCI starting with defining what data needs to be protected, example,  primary account number (PAN), cardholder name, expiration, verification, stripe and chip data, PINs etc
* applies to entities that store, transmit and process card (debit and credit) transactions
* in 2006 and 2009 there were major credit card breaches at TJ Maxx, where 45 million records were breached, and at Heartland Payment Systems, where 130 million records were breached
* this reinforced the criticality of PCI and led to the release of DSS 2.0 in 2010, 3.0 in 2013 and 4.0 in 2022
* within PCI, there are a number of different security standards; each focuses on a different aspect of payment card transactions
    - example: standards on encryption, PIN security, point-of-sale devices etc
    - DSS (data security standard) affects virtually every organisation that is covered by PCI: organisations that store, process or transmit debit/credit card transactions

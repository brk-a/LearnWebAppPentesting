|requirement|what it |what you must do|
|:---:|:---|:---|
|2.2.7|secure access to admin consoles including encryption of all communications|look at API access to consoles as well and not only encrypting the communication but also controlling access to those endpoints|
|6.0| the core of DSS 4.0 with respect to securing payment related applications|<ol><li>APIs are 100% in scope now</li><li>BCSW, the code you write to power your organisation's unique offerings, is powered by APIs; said APIs need to be secured as much, or even more, than your classic web and mobile applications</li></ol>|
|6.2.1| engineers must be aware of API security and vulnerability risks to ensure code is free of flaws that can be exploited|integrate as far left as possible to find vulnerabilities before they reach production|
|6.2.2|annual training of developers| APIs have unique attack patterns, therefore, it is critical that your developers understand what these look like and how to create more secure applications|
|6.2.3|organisations must review and test code for security flaws|DSS highlights how attackers are targeting your custom code via the APIs and looking to find and exploit logic vulnerabilities|
|6.2.4| covers a wide range of well known application attack types and mirrors closely the threats listed in the OWASP application and API security top 10 lists| your vulnerability discovery efforts need to cover APIs not just UIs|
|6.3.1| organisations must implement vulnerability management programmes|<ol><li>focus on the vulnerabilities that are likely to cause the most damage</li><li>injections and XSS are legitimate vulnerabilities; these rarely are the cause of major breaches</li><li> the regulars are logic flaws, weak authentication and authorisation gaps</li><li> test for these vulnerabilities instead especially at the API level</li></ol>
|6.3.2|  organisations must develop and maintain an accurate and up to date inventory of all BCSW|<ol><li>must include your APIs</li><li>accurate inventory is part of a solid application governance programme where you standardise how APIs get created, set security policies that are implemented consistently and all APIs get tested and deployed in a common way</li></ol>
|6.4.1| organisations have an option to perform either periodic vulnerability assessments or implement runtime attack detection and blocking| option goes away in 2025 when all PCI covered entities must enforce active detection and blocking<span>&#x2A;</span>|
|7.0 | strong access controls|<ol><li> examine the entire infrastructure and application stack</li><li> look at what users can access and what they can see</li>review these controls down to the individual API endpoint level to make sure that access gaps are close</li><li>implement continuous testing to uncover and alert on any changes in access permissions</li></ol>
|10.0 |organisations must capture logs from all systems involved in payment processing|<ol><li>critical to detect threats and perform root cause analysis</li><li>capture user activity logs on APIs as well; this is best accomplished with an API gateway</li></ol>
|11.0| organisations must perform regular testing of their custom software| make sure that includes all of your APIs|

&#x2A; not all threats can be detected in real time. There's no magic firewall that will protect against all threats, and in fact, frequently the most damaging exploits aren't detectable. So you need to keep up testing and detection of vulnerabilities, and then fix this in the code.

# why API sec for PCI?
### fun ~~facts~~ ~~stats~~ ... stuff
* 83% of all internet traffic is API calls according to akamai
* _c._ 41 to 75 billion USD is the average API-related cyber loss according to imperva, marsh mclennan
* 4% of API testing is specifically for security according to stateofapis.com
### evolution of app security
* apps are developed faster, shall we say, more... *agile*
* devs are reliedupon to secure code
* cloud-native challengeshave established certain approaches to development
* existing app sec controls are not effective in the new app security environment
* gartner hype cycle for app sec 2023
    * API attacks have resulted in a stream of data breaches; devSecOps teams have increasingly become interested in API testing and security, however, our traditional AST tools, application security testing tools were not originally designed to test for some of the vulnerabilities associated with typical attacks against APIs
### API attacks are different
* traditional ap scanners are vulnerable to comon flaws: XSS, CSRF, misconfigs etc
* API attacks taret logic flaws, authorisation gaps, weak authentication etc
* [apisecurity.io][def] is a great resource on API breaches

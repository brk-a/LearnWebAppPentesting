# best practices
### governance
*  integrate security into the entire application lifecycle: design, product and retirement
* create a culture of security throughout your organisation
* define your API policies: how your APIs get used, who can use them and what they can do
* define your standards: what APIs should look like and how do they get created
* standardise your processes: how do APIs move from development through QA and into production in a consistent manner
* centralise all your APIs in a common platform, say, an API gateway or a marketplace; this will let you manage APIs consistently, define common policies and give you a central source for auditing and logging user behaviour
* make sure all your APIs only go into production having passed the required gates including documentation, testing, security audit and so on
### culture
* have a culture of security within the engineering and development organisations
* many roundtables with cybersecurity leaders have shown a pattern: the CISOs uniformly agreed on the need to integrate security into the development team
* one of the best ways to create that security awareness was to embed security champions right into those teams
* w.r.t. applications and APIs, development shares the responsibility for security seeing as most vulnerabilities require dev involvement to remediate
* security champions are security-savvy personnel who can work and operate directly within the development organisation: they provide insights, best practices, answer questions and so on
### API security training to all relevant employees
* include any developers creating APIs, any API product owners and ops teams
* APIs face new and different types of attacks, therefore, make sure the training covers API specific threats, the OWASP API Security Top 10 and best practices for keeping APIs secure
### testing
* APIs expose a lot of application functionality;  it is great to pressure-test that functionality to make sure your apps can not be abused
* this means testing every API endpoint across all kinds of attack types: everything you see in the OWASP Top 10, for example
* also, examine your app logic to find any flaws or gaps that can be exploited
* automate as much as possible: implement a testing program that will run automatically, create the test coverage you need and run against every release to find vulnerabilities before they get to production

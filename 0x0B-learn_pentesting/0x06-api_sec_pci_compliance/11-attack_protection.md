# DSS 4.0 requirements 6.4.1 and 6.4.2: attack protection
### defined approach requirements
#### 6.4.1 public-facing web applications
* new threats and vulnerabilities are addressed on an ongoing basis and these applications are protected against known attacks as follows
    - reviewing public-facing web applications via manual
    - automated application vulnerability security assessment tools or methods as follows
        - at least once every 12 months and after significant changes
        - by an entity that specialises in application security
        - including, at a minimum, all common software attacks in requirement 6.2.4
        - all vulnerabilities are ranked in accordance with requirement 6.3.1
        - all vulnerabilities are corrected
        - the application is re-evaluated after the corrections
    - ##### ------ OR ------
    - installing an automated technical solution(s) that continually detect and prevent web-based attacks as follows
        - installed in front of public-facing web applications to detect and prevent web-based attacks
        - actively running and up to date as applicable
        - generating audit logs
        - configured to either block web-based attacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated
#### 6.4.2 public-facing web applications
* an automated technical solution is deployed that continually detects and prevents web-based attacks with at least the following
    - is installed in front of public-facing web applications and is configured to detect and prevent web-based attacks
    - actively running and up to date as applicable
    - generates audit logs
    - configured to either block web-based attacks or generate an alert that is immediately investigated
### implications for APIs
* public apps and APIs are primary targets of attacks
* perform vuln assessment annually or install automated detection and blocking SW (the latter is mandatory at the end og 31/March/2025 onwards)
* use WAF for common attacks (XSS, CSRF, SQLi etc)
* test, test, test; logic attacks sre difficult to detect and block
### good practice
* deploy manual and/or automated vulnerability security assessment tools/methods
* include processes that facilitate timely responses  to alerts generated by automated solutions so that any attacks detected may be mitigated

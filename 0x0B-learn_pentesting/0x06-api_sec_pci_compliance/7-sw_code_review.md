# DSS 4.0 requirement 6.2.3: software code review
### defined approach requirements
* reviews make sure that code is developed according to secure coding guidelines
* look for  existing and emerging SW vulnerabilities
* make appropriate corrections and implementations before release
### customised approach objective
* bespoke (and custom) SW, BCSW, cannot be exlplioted using coding vulnerabilities
### applicability notes
* code reviews must be part of the SDLC for public-facing and internal BCSW
* public-facing and internal web apps are also subject to controls defined by PCI-DSS requirement 6.4
* said reviews must be manual and/or automated
### defined approach testing procedures
* examined the SW dev procedures doc and interview responsible personnel to verify that processes are defined for each BCSW to be reviewd in accordance to this requirement
* examine evidence of changes to BCSW to verify that the code changes were reviewed in accordance with this requirement
### good practice
* check for logical vulnerabilities
* sanitise user input
* search for undocumented features (implant tools, back doors etc)
* confirm that BCSW uses external component's function(s) e.g. frameworks, libraries, APIs etc. securely
* make sure logging is performed correctly so that sensitive data does not get into the logs
* analyse insecure code structure(s) because they may contain potential vulnerabilities outlines in req 6.2.5
* check BCSW behaviour to detect logical vulnerabilities

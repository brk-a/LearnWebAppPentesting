# extra: insufficient logging and monitoring

#### injection vectors
* an attacker sends commands to an app and said commands are executed as though they were from a legitimate user
* most common types:
    * SQL injection
    * NoSQL injection
    * XSS
    * OS injection

#### injection flaws
* an API is vulnerable to injection flows when:
    * logs reveal patterns in API usage
    * logs provide audit trail of activities
    * logs reveal sensitive data

#### insufficient logging and monitoring
* an attacker takes advantage of zero logging and monitoring mechanisms to abuse systems w/o being noticed
* it is almost impossible to track suspicious actitivies let alone respond to them in a timely manner w/o or with insufficient logging and monitoring
* attackers have plenty of time to compromise systems w/o visibility over ongoing malicious activities

#### what to do
* make sure logs cannot be altered once created
* sanitise input
* make errors verbose
* seperate data from commands
* write logs for a log management solution. include detail to id malicious actors
* treat logs as sensitive data
* use a SIEM (security info event management) programme
* configure custom alerts to detect suspicious actitivies earlier in the process

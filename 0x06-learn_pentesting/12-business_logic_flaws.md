# business logic flaws

* are ways of using the legitimate processing flow of an application in a way that results in a negative consequence to the organization. example:
    * purchase orders are not processed before midnight
    * written authorisation is not on file before web access is granted
    * transactions in excess of KES 100,000.00 are not reviewed by a person
* the following, among others, are not business logic flaws
    * performing a denial of service by locking an auction user’s account
    * posting unvalidated input to the public
    * cracking MD5 hashes
    * brute-forcing a password recovery scheme

#### rule of thumb
* if you need to truly understand the business to understand the vulnerability, you may have a business-logic problem on your hands; if you do not understand the business, you ca not see business logic flaws

#### risk factors

>  depends on the circumstances

* threat agents who could possibly exploit the problem
* can the problem be detected?
* can you understand the business?


the vulnerabilities themselves are, often, quite easy to discover and exploit without any special tools or techniques as they are a supported part of the application
business logic flaws are often the most critical in terms of consequences as they are deeply tied into the company’s process

# unsafe consumption of APIs

#### API specific
#### Business specific
#### Exploitability: easy
#### Prevalence: common
#### Detectability: average
#### Technical: servere


### threat agents/attack vectors
* exploiting this issue requires attackers to identify and potentially compromise other APIs/services the target API is integrated with
* usually, this information is not publicly available or the integrated API/service is not easily exploitable
### security weakness
* developers tend to trust and not verify the endpoints that interact with external or third-party APIs; they rely on weaker security requirements such as those regarding transport security, authentication/authorisation and input validation and sanitisation
* attackers need to identify services the target API integrates with (data sources) and, eventually, compromise them

### impact
* the impact varies according to what the target API does with data pulled.
* successful exploitation may lead to sensitive information exposure to unauthorised actors, many kinds of injections or DoS

### example
* 

### how To prevent
* when evaluating service providers, assess their API security posture
* ensure all API interactions happen over a secure communication channel (TLS)
* always validate and properly sanitise data received from integrated APIs before using it
* maintain an allowlist of well-known locations integrated APIs may redirect yours to: do not blindly follow redirects

# ReDoS

#### what the code does
* listens for a `POST` request at `vslidateEmail` endpoint
* checks whether `email` supplied by the request, `req.body.email`, matches the regex in `emailRegex`
* matches: returns `200` and a success message
* does not match: returns `400` and an error message

#### what TF is ReDoS?
* regex denial of service
* a DoS attack that exploits the fact that some regular expression implementations reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size)
* an attacker may cause a programme using a regex to enter these extreme situations and then hang
* more info on ReDos and evil regex [here][def]

#### the vulnerability
* ReDoS

#### why it is vulnerable
* input (the email part) is not in the control of us devs; it is controlled by the user (the person entering the email). said user can enter anything they want
* big O. the web is regex-based. regex engines in use as of Tuesday, 29 Aug, 2023, solve not only “pure” regexes, but also “expanded” ones (with “special additions” such as back-references that cannot be always be solved efficiently), therefore,  even if the regex is not “expanded” a naïve algorithm is used

#### what now?
* use a validator
* use module `validator`  to check whether `req.body.email` is an email

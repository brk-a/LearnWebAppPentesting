# security misconfiguration

#### what the code does
* 
* runs in the root of a JS app
* creates an `app` dir
* copy `package.json` or equivalent (where dependencies are stored)
* sets user privileges to `root`
* runs `npm install`
* copys the source of the app to that dir
* runs the app on port 8080

#### what TF is security misconfiguration?
*  any error or vulnerability present in the configuration of code that allows attackers to access sensitive data

#### the vulnerability
* security misconfiguration

#### why it is vulnerable
* user privileges are set to `root`
* anything that happens after that is done using `root` permissions (which is all of them)
* we can execute malicious code as `root` w/i the app and, to some extent, w/i the machine/device the app runs on

#### what now?
* QED; set user privileges to normal user viz

    ```docker
        USER node
    ```

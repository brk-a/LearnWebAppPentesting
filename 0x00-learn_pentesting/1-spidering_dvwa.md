# Spidering & DVWA

* idea is to see how spidering works, in theory, on Burp
* punching bag: [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) in [Metasploitable](https://information.rapid7.com/download-metasploitable-2017.html)
* purpose of spidering is to establish the scope of the pen test
* you map out the webapp; useful for finding links and web forms
* automatic spidering: Burp follows links, identifies forms and creates a representation of the file structure of the webapp
    * it records all the requests and responses to and from the webapp as it performs spidering

### how to _spider_
* open Burp. refer to [0-burp.md](./0-burp.md)
* click the `Spider` tab
* there are only two tabs under it: `Control` and `Options`
    * `Control`  has two sections:
        1. `Spider Status` settings are used to monitor and control Burp Spider; start and stop _Spider_, clear queues etc
        2. `Spider Scope` allows you to choose between two scopes: a custom scope and a standard one (defined in the `Target` tab )
    * `Options` has six sections:
        1. `Crawler Settings` controls the way Spider crawls for basic web content
        2. `Passive Spidering` monitors traffic through Burp Proxy (the `Proxy` tab) to update the site map w/o making new requests
        3. `Form Submission` controls whether Spider submits HTML forms and how, if it happens, it will be done
        4. `Application Login` controls how Spider submits login forms
        5. `Spider Engine` controls the engine used to make HTTP requests during spidering
        6. `Request Headers` controls the request headers used in HTTP requests made by Spider
    * Spider should, by default, be paused. if not, click the `Spider is running` button. also, click the radio button next to `Use suite scope`
    * under `Options`, click all the checkboxes under `Crawler settings` so that they are checked
    * `Maximum link depth` tells Spider how many links deep it should dive for any link it encounters. default is 5, keep it between 3 and 5; best not to touch it at all
    * enable passive spidering by clicking the checkbox next to `Passively spider as you browse`. best not to touch the link depth setting
    * do not touch the default settings in the `Form Submission` and `Application Login` sections
    * under `Spider Engine` leave the defaults as is. number of threads can be kept between 2 and 5; this is the exception, not the norm
* you are all set; time to _spider_

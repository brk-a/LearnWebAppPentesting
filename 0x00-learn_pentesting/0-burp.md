# Burp suite
version to use: community (free) version

* an inegrated platform for performing security testing of web apps
* intercepts the data being sent between a browser and webapp
* intercepted data can be inspected, manipulated then sent on to webapp or browser etc

### set up proxy
using Firefox; other browsers can be used too
* go to `Preferences`
* scroll to `Network Proxy`; click on `Settings` right under it
* click the `Manual proxy configuration` radio button
* in the `HTTP Proxy` field, type `127.0.0.1` and in the `Port` field next to it type `8080`
* click the checkbox that says `Use this proxy server for all protocols`
* click `OK` at the bottom right of the modal (or dialog box, if you like)
* open Burp Suite
* click `Next` at the bottom right of the modal
* click `Start Burp` in the next modal
* click the `Proxy` tab
* click the `Options` tab
* make sure the proxy and port listed  _Proxy Listeners_ are the same as the ones set above. if they are not, click `Add` and follow instructions
* click the checkbox under `Running` in the _Proxy Listeners_ section; the checkbox should be checked so that the proxy listener works
* under `Proxy`, click the `Intercept` tab
* set intercept mode to _off_; click `Intercept is off`
* in your browser, go to a website of your choice (use [example.com](https://www.example.com) as a baseline)
* in Burp, click `HTTP History`. you will see the relevant HTTP details of the website you just visited; click any of them. at the bottom, there are two tabs: `Request` and `Response`; these are for HTTP requests and responses respectively. under that, there are three tabs: `raw` for raw HTTP request/response, `Headers` for HTTP headers and `Hex` for the hex format of the request/response (`raw` may have been replaced by `Pretty`; that is alright)
* click the `Intercept` tab
* set intercept mode to _on_; click `Intercept is on`
* in your browser, go to a website of your choice. the browser warns that the connection is not safe because it detects that data is being intercepted (does not know by what or who; it simply knows that data is being intercepted). Burp is _actively_ intercepting data. allow the browser to carry on by following instructions and adding the exception it shows
* in Burp, under `Intercept`, buttons `Forward`, `Drop` and `Action` should be active (because Burp is actively intercepting data). click on `Forward`; it, well, forwards the data to the intended destination

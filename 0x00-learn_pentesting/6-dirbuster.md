# DirBuster

* idea is to see how `dirbuster` works
* punching bag: [OWASP Broken Access Web App](https://owasp.org/www-project-broken-web-applications/migrated_content)
* DirBuster is a tool made by OWASP to use brute-forcing techniques to find commonly used directory and file names on servers
* allows a pentester, especially a bug bounty hunter or one performing CTFs, to:
    1.  understand how files and directories fit in the structure of a web app/site
    2. find hidden files and/or directories
* allows a pentester to determine:
    1. what attack approach to use
    2. what methods to apply
    3. what attack vectors to leverage
* dirbuster sends HTTP `GET` requests and awaits responses from the web app/site. it tests a directory/file on the target against those in the wordlist(s). if it receives a `200` response, then it knows that that directory/file exists, therefore, it enumerates the directory/file


### the flow
* fire up `dirbuster`
* enter the URL of the site/app to _dir-bust_
* enter the port to use
    * definitley HTTP (because URL); either 80 or 443
* select wordlist(s)
* configure your preferred settings
* scan

### how to _dir-bust_
* fire up `owaspbwa`
* select a target webapp (here, I use `Broken WordPress`); should open on the browser
* copy the URL of the target webapp
* fire up `dirbuster`
* paste the target URL in the `Target URL` input field
* tick the checkbox that says `Go Faster`. this controls how fast the requests will be sent; too many and you raise suspicion or crash the server, too litle and you are inefficient
* set the `Select scannning type` to `List based brute force`
* select a wordlist. in Kali Linux and ParrotOS, these are in `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster`
    * here, I use `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`
* do not touch the rest of the settings
* click `Start` at the bottom right

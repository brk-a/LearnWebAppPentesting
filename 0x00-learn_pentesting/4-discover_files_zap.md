#  Discovering hidden files with ZAP

* idea is to see how to discover hidden files in a web app/site
* tools Burp Suite Pro or ZAP
* punching bag: `Mutillidae`
* why disciver hidden files?
    * good question...
        1. admin login pages could be among those hidden
        2. there could be data that makes your work easy e.g. list of usernames and passwords
        3. spidering does not detect hidden files
* 

### preamble
* OWASP (open web application security project)
    * a non-profit whose aim is to improve the security of software
    * OWASP has a project called zed attack proxy (abbr. ZAP)
    * ZAP is a free security tool that finds security vulnerabilities during development and testing of software. also a great tool for pentesters
    * ZAP is free, completely free (unlike Burp Suite); it does everything Burp does. the only reason to use Burp over ZAP is when the project requirements state explicitly that Burp should be used
    * Burp is to ZAP what corporate is to techies; contrived, head-up-arse people that hide their insecurities behind bureaucracy and long, senseless corporate statements


### how to ZAP
* fire up ZAP ~~or Burp Pro~~. the dashboard has two broad sections: the top and bottom ones. the top one is divided into two: right and left. the bottom one fills the entire width and has tabs right above it. the top left section will have te files yo will work with,  the top right has an input field to attack URLs and the bottom section is for information/statuses
* set proxy (ip: 127.0.0.1 and port 8080)
* fire up `Mutillidae`
* set up proxy in ZAP. they are in `Options` which is under `Proxy` in the `Tools` tab
    * select `Local Proxies` on the left of the modal that comes up
    * set the proxy address to `localhost` and port to `8080`. you can change ports as you wish, however, be consistent with what you entered in your browser
    * click `OK` at the bottom
* reload `Mutillidae`. there should be some result in ZAP even though intercept has not been set, yet; one of those files is `mutillidae`
    * notice how easy it is to obtain the file structure; very efficient
* in ZAP, select `mutillidae`, right click and hover over `Attack`; click `Spider` in the drop-down menu that appears
* click `Start Scan` at the bottom of the modal that appears; voila! webapp is spidered
* select `mutillidae`, right click and hover over `Attack`; click `Forced Browse directory (and children)` in the drop-down menu that appears
* in the bottom section, a tab named `Forced Browse` appears. click it
*  select the default list in the `List` drop-down menu
* select `mutillidae`, right click and hover over `Attack`; click `Forced Browse directory (and children)` in the drop-down menu that appears
* check the top left section; there will be a lot more files now. skim/inspect them and find those that are odd out
    * in the case of mutillidae, there is a `.txt` file containing usernames and passwords called `accounts.txt` and a link to the `register` page (to register an account)
* right click on a file you that caught your attention and copy link
* paste link in browser and see where it leads

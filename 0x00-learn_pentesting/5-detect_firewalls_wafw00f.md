# Web application firewall detection with WAFW00F

* WAF --> web app firewalls. WAFW00F is a WAF detection tool
* firewalls are pre-emptive measures (procedures, harware and software) against unauthorised access and/or attacks
    * from a white hat perspective, WAFs make your life easier; they prevent _c._ 20% of possible attacks
    * from a black hat perspective, WAFs make life a little less easy (_less easy_ is not _hard_); they are, simply another hoop to jump through. all you have to do is know what encoding method the web app/site uses so you can send manipulated data without being detected
* assumption: you are using a UNIX/Linux distribution, preferably Kali Linux

### how to WAFW00F
* open a terminal window
* run the command `wafw00f` (yes; zeroes, not Os)
* it should show you how to use it

# defending against sql injection
* not an easy task; this is partly why this technique is still in use
* defence methods include:
    1. sanitised code
        - input validation
        - parameterised queries
        - stored procedures
        - escape sequences
        - etc
    2. multi-layer defence
        - layer 1: secure code &rarr; see #1 above
        - layer 2: host-based WAF &rarr; app installed on a host that filters, monitors and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service
        - layer 3: edge-sided WAF &rarr; app installed on the edge, say, a DNS server, that filters, monitors and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service eg. [Cloudflare][def2]

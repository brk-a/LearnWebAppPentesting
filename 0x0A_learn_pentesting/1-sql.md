# sql
* basics of sql with the aim of learning how to write injectable sql queries
* assume we use a mysql-style db (probably MariaDB)
* assume that mysql has been installed and started
### terminal
* spin a session using the following command

    ```bash
        mysql -u root #no password
    ```

* create a db

    ```sql
        create database myDb;
    ```

* see if db was created

    ```sql
        show databases;
    ```

* select the db

    ```sql
        use myDb;
    ```

* see if there are any tables

    ```sql
        show tables;
    ```

* create a table

    ```sql
        create table users(
            id: uuid not null primary key,
            uname: varchar(20) not null,
            passwd: text not null,
        );
    ```

* see if table was created

    ```sql
        select * from users;
    ```

* create an entry (a row)

    ```sql
        insert into users (id, uname, passwd)
        values(
            "462c9658-11cd-43b4-b106-b6c8a5df268d",
            "goatmatata",
            "ef92b778bafe771e89245b89ecbc08a44a4e166c06659911881f383d4473e94f",
        )
        returning *;
    ```

* see if row was created

    ```sql
        select * from users;
    ```

* more sql

    ```sql
        -- delete a table
        drop table users;

        -- delete a db
        drop database myDb;

        --show user (currently logged in)
        select user();

        --show version
        select version();

        --show dbs that are up
        select database();
    ```

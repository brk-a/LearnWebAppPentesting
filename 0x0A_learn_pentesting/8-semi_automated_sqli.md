# semi-automated sql injection
* for instances where the <sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub>s are large such that one cannot exhaust them manually
* example: 

    ```sql
            select * from users
            where uname="goatmatata"
            and passwd="ef92b778bafe771e89245b89ecbc08a44a4e166c06659911881f383d4473e94f"
            or length(database())="1";
            -- returns null because the length of the db name evaluates to `false` (name of db is not one char long)
    ```

    - you can keep doing `length(database())="N";` where N = {1, 2, ...}, however, is this, really, necessary? say the length of the db name is 20 characters; are you sure you want to do this? say you want to do this; are you sure you want to run <sup>26</sup>C<sub>20</sub> combinations, worst case scenario? (assuming db name is composed solely of the 26 letters of the [latin script][def])

* semi-automation tools are like vehicles: they get you to your destination quickly and conveniently, however, you must steer/control them

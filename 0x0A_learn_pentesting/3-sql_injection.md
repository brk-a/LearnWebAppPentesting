# sql injection
### categories
* three types
    * in-band
    * inferential
    * out-of-band
#### in-band sql injection
* occurs when an attacker (me) is able to launch an attack on and receive a response from the attacked website/app on the same communication channel
* response can be data or error
* think data object when filtering items on an e-commerce site by any parameter (price, colour, material or other spec)
* this type of injection lends itself to various techniques
    1. union-based injection
        - attacker uses the `UNION` operator
        - leverages said operator to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result which is. then, returned as part of the HTTP response
    2. error-based injection
        - attacker capitalises on the fact that the db returns an error message
        - relies on error messages thrown by the database server to obtain information about the structure of the database
#### inferential sql injection
* occurs when an attacker cannot get a response from a website/app
* no data is actually transferred via the website/app, therefore, the attacker cannot see the result of an attack in-band (which is why such attacks are aka *blind SQL injection attacks*)
* attacker has to *infer* why the website/app behaves as it does and decide what course of action to take
    * an attacker is able to reconstruct the database structure by sending payloads and  observing the website/appâ€™s response and the behaviour of the db server
* lends itself to the following techniques of attack
    1. boolean-based injection
        - send a SQL query to the db and judge whether the payload used returns true or false
        - depending on the boolean result (true or false), the content within the HTTP response will change or remain the same
        - it is a slow attack; this helps the attacker to enumerate the db
    2. time-based injection
        - observe how long it takes to request a page or other resource
        - tells the attacker how long the server takes to process a request
#### out-of-band sql injection
* occurs when an attacker cannot receive a response from the attacked website/app on the same communication channel used to launch an attack but, instead, is able to cause the application to send data to a remote endpoint that they control
* only possible if the server that you are using has commands that trigger DNS or HTTP requests; that is the case with all popular SQL servers
